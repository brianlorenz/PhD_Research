# PhD_Research

Repository that contains all of my graduate school coding work for my research

Split into 3 subfolders:

courses - everything done as part of my coursework, including an interactive visualization tool.

mosdef_code - everything for my first two projects involving the MOSDEF survey, including data pipelines for stacking spectra, measuring emission lines, and clustering galaxies with similar shapes. 

uncover_code - everything done for my later two projects involving the UNCOVER survey, including data pipelines for measuring emission line fluxes directly from images and creating spatially resolved emission line maps.
